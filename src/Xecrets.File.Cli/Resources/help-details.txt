*** IMPORTANT ***

Always test on copies of non-essential files before using this program on real data. Encryption is
no protection against data loss, always keep adequate backups of your important files.

There is no backdoor or password reset function! If you encrypt a file, and do not know the original
password or have access to a private key matching a public key used when encrypting the file, the
contents of the file is irretrievably lost and cannot be recovered.

GNU General Public License for more details, use the --gpl-license option.

Options are case-sensitive, and except (global) are processed in order. The --dryrun option is
useful to verify the syntax and correctness of the options. Since files may be created by previous
steps, a dry run does not validate the existance of input files.

All log output and error messages are written to stderr, but you can redirect it with --stdout.

Xecrets File encrypts using a password and optionally one or more public keys. Anyone can generate a
key pair consisting of a publick key and a private key, and then share the public key to others so
they can encrypt files that only the holder of the private key can decrypt. This is very useful to
enable encryption without a password being used, thus minimizing the risk of it being exposed. It
can also be very useful for computer to computer file transfers, thus enabling the sending system to
send data without even being able to decrypt the result.

*** TIP ***

Log to stdout and use 'more' to paginate the help text, i.e.: --stdout --help --help | more
